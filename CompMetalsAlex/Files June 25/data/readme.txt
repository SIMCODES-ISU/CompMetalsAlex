Each csv file contains the undamped couloumb/electrostatic energy, and the S_ij and R_ij values used for the damping function calculation for each sample.

These values range from 4x4 (16 Sij and Rij values) to 21x21 (441 Sij and Rij values).

Undamped Coulomb/Electrostatic Energy = CHARGE-CHARGE + CHARGE-DIPOLE + CHARGE-QUADRUPOLE + CHARGE-OCTUPOLE + DIPOLE-DIPOLE + DIPOLE-QUADRUPOLE + QUADRUPOLE-QUADRUPOLE


Total Coulomb/Electrostatic Energy = Undamped Coul. E. + Damping function term (aka OVERLAP PENETRATION ENERGY)
