Random Seed for split replicability: 43
Run for approx 1.5hs
Allowed expressions and settings:

model = PySRRegressor(
        niterations = n_iter,
        binary_operators=["+", "*", "-", "^", "/"],
        unary_operators=["log", "exp", "sqrt", "cbrt"],
        elementwise_loss="loss(x, y) = (x - y)^2",
        maxsize=30,
        model_selection="best",
        verbosity=1,
        complexity_of_variables=2,
        constraints={"/": (-1, 1)}, # -1: Arbitrary complexity; 1: Only constants
    )

For division, only division by constants allowed (to avoid discontinuities)
Cbrt and Sqrt introduce non-differentiable points at 0, but the functions are continuous.
