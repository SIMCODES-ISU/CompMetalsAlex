Quadratic Fit Polynomial: -0.0008 + 1.6968(Overlap Pen. E) + 17.0727(Overlap Pen. E):


We are testing: What gives a lower error, undamped + overlap Pen. E. or undamped + quadratic overlap polynomial?

Overlap Penetration Energy:
Number of files: 354
The MAE is: 0.002165020441779665
The MSE is: 1.642721248974026e-05
The RMSE is: 0.004053049776370907

Quadratic Polynomial:
Number of files: 354
The MAE is: 0.001583026112590392
The MSE is: 9.763280729375204e-06
The RMSE is: 0.0031246248941873334

The R2 for the polynomial on the training data is 0.8222673896724464.
Obviously, the polynomial is better fitted to the data it has seen in training.
However, using the polynomial lowers RMSE and MAE in the test data as well, as seen below.

Overlap Pen. Energy:

The MAE is: 0.002832628630728819
The MSE is: 0.0001296626373530692
The RMSE is: 0.011386950309589887

Polynomial:

The R2 score is 0.41811628986937466 when fitting the polynomial to SAPT - Undamped on the test data, which is obviously lower than on training data.
Yet the quadratic polynomial outperforms the "raw" Overlap Pen. E. on the test data. 

The MAE is: 0.00226269451693536
The MSE is: 0.00011301908039667163
The RMSE is: 0.010631043241219162


MAE on test data: 20% lower
RMSE on test data: 7% lower
